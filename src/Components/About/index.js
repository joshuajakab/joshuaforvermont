                <h3 className='about-text'>Joshua John Ferguson has been called a "citizen senator" long before winning the 2022 Vermont Primary state senate nomination by write-in vote. He is a civic innovator who embodies what he calls "the civic spirit of Vermont." His body of work, like his civic engagement, is diverse and has brought people together across cultures, disciplines and sectors to solve real-world issues facing communities.<br /><br />



                    Joshua Ferguson was born in Rutland City, Vermont, a lifelong and many-generation Vermonter. Raised in Castleton and Fair Haven, Ferguson has deep roots in Rutland County and Vermont. He comes from a working, blue-collar family with a rich history of service to the nation, tracing to the Green Mountain Boys and patriots in every subsequent generation.<br /><br />



                    He graduated from Fair Haven Union High School in 2008 and later attended Green Mountain College, then graduated from Castleton University summa cum laude, a first-generation college student. At Castleton University, he studied International Political Economy, Governance, and Human Rights. Ferguson then earned his public health degree from Columbia University with a focus on health policy, population and family health.<br /><br />



                    Ferguson has an extensive background of service in communities across the county and state. He has supported public health organizations, youth organizations, and leadership development to raise a new generation of Vermont citizens and leaders. He has worked to uplift the "civic spirit of Vermont" in his professional, humanitarian, and public service endeavors.<br /><br />



                    As an outgrowth of his service to Rutland, he was the youngest partner of Project VISION during its formative years. He has also coached local youth sports and served on the board of Mentor Connector. This included advocating to popularize mentoring and afterschool enrichment opportunities, while devoting time to expanding youth programs and stepping up to the plate as a baseball coach. Through dedicated service he has worked toward the betterment of Vermont communities.<br /><br />



                    He has supported young entrepreneurs in forming businesses to bolster economic growth and expand opportunity in Rutland County. He remains a strong proponent of private and public sector partnerships with conservative economic values and socially mindful solutions to challenges long-affecting communities in Vermont. He has said, "My definition of sustainability incorporates fiscal responsibility, accountability, and forward-thinking planning to ensure resources and public assets are wisely invested and budgets can be balanced as we pursue progress and promote innovation."<br /><br />



                    Ferguson has worked professionally for six years to restore sailboats. He has volunteered with the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum in support of restoration efforts, and he has visited United States Coast Guard Cutter (USCGC) restoration projects as well as shipwreck sites throughout the hemisphere. He is a strong advocate for clean water, clean oceans, and access to sailing and maritime heritage as a treasured American pastime. <br /><br />



                    On the water he is a sailor, and on the ground he is a civic innovator committed to working toward a brighter future for Vermont.</h3>
